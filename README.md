## Thougts
 The game has perfomance issues due to the large number of rendered objects. And I have few ideas for optimization but, unfortunately don't have time to implement them at the moment 😮‍💨
 Anyway, it was pretty fun to try Flame for the first time, but it's obvious that the developers of Flame and Flutter have a lot of work to do to make Flutter a cool game engine.
 Definitly, I'll give it another try someday.
